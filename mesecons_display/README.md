This mod adds a version of mesecons' lightstone that use the dark gray texture when off, to allow the creation of more legible displays.

They are crafted identically to normal lightstone, but with a meselamp instead of a torch.


This mod does not include any textures. Some code was copy/pasted from mesecons, which is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version 3, so I therefore license this mod under the same license.
