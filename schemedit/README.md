It supports node porbabilities, forced node placement and slice probabilities.

It adds 3 items:

* Schematic Creator: Used to mark a region and export it as schematic
* Schematic Void: Marks a position in a schematic which should not replace anything when placed as a schematic
* Schematic Node Probability Tool: Set per-node probabilities and forced node placement

It also adds the server command `placeschem` to place a schematic.

## Usage help
Usage help can be found when you use the optional Help modpack (mods `doc` and `doc_items`).
